# ATOM mobile robot platform with odometry
Naming the bot ATOM. Planning it to be a mobile robot software platfrom with 
  * Simple available bot chassi
  * odometry (Wheel encoder (Ext ISR), acc, gyro (I2C) etc)
  * two dc motors
  * ping ultrasound 
  * Communication Google-pbuf, bluetooth/UART, I2C
  * Arduino with freeRTOS
  * ...

Will try all the concepts of robotics over it. From simple straight line move to SLAM and DNNs.
